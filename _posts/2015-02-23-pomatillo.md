## About
With Pomatillo, planning and tracking your projects has never been easier.

Utilizing a work method that alternates timed, uninterrupted work segments with timed breaks can boost productivity. Pomatillo makes this simple to manage.

Pomatillo was originally a project for Rails Rumble, a 48 hour hackathon.  My wife and I created Pomatillo for the project to solve a need that we have.  We are continually adding new features and it is 100% free!

## Features
Using Pomatillo, you can easily create and track your projects and tasks. The built in timer will help you set a 25 minute work timer. Once your Pom is finished, we will automatically track your Pom count.
