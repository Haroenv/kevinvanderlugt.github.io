[Homebrew Weekly](http://homebrewweekly.com) is a weekly curated newsletter full of interesting, relevant homebrewing links.

In the homebrewing community, there is an incredible amount of great blogs and information put out weekly. It takes a long time to read through all the articles weekly so I curate the most interesting articles into a simple well designed email newsletter weekly.

This is a side project to learn more about my fascination of homebrewing beer.
