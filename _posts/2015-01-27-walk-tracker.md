## About
Walk Tracker was intended to be incredibly simplistic. While visiting Seville we wanted to track all our walks around the various amazing streets. This project was created to help learn a full application in Swift while also accomplishing a simple walking tracker.

[Check out the source code on Github](https://github.com/kevinvanderlugt/Swift-Walk-Tracker)

## Features
There are really only two major features, track current walks using the GPS and review previous walks. This project was intended to be a small scope of features done really well.

## Want to help?

I am definitely interested in seeing what other people would be interested in adding. This project is fully open sourced and can be found on my [Github portfolio](https://github.com/kevinvanderlugt/Swift-Walk-Tracker).  Send over any questions or pull requests! I would also love to work with an app designer to create an icon and loading screen.
